Enter the name or ID of the Pokémon you want to search for in the search input field. Click the "Search" button. The application will display information about the Pokémon, including its name, ID, weight, height, and base stats. Click the "Add to favorite" button to add the Pokémon to your favorites list. To view your favorite Pokémon, click the "Favorites" tab. To remove all favorite Pokémon, click the "Clear favorites" button.

The application uses the PokéAPI to fetch Pokémon data, so an internet connection is required. Favorite Pokémon are stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage feature, so they will persist even if you close the browser or refresh the page.
